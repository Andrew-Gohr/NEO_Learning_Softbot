# NEO_Learning_Softbot
An agent that learns information and builds associations between objects in its environment

NEO is an attempt to simulate how people learn from experience with objects in the real world and how we can replicate that understanding within machines. For Fall semester 17, S.A.I. is creating a text based environment in which our agent is given objects to learn from and find commonalities between those objects. This project is divided into 3 main folders:

### matrix
The matrix folder contains all files relating to the makeup of the environment. The "text_environment.py" file is the driver file for the program

### object
the object folder contains any files relating to objects and their attributes. For now attributes are just string and integer values, but in the future we hope to add more assets such as images and sounds.

### neo_body
This folder contains all of the parts necessary for NEO to function and learn in its environment.

This program runs off of python 3.2+ code. You will need to install 3.2 or higher to run the project.
